The proposed scenario involves simulating a bottle-filling plant, wherein a manufacturing line produces various bottle types requiring segregation. Detection of different bottle types within frames through a pre-trained YOLO V3 model is used. NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) is used to eliminate duplicate bounding boxes and to refine the final bounding boxes.
